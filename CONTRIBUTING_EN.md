# Contributing Guide

This project is in an **early stage (very early)** and is being developed openly. Some decisions are not yet consolidated, parts may break, and the scope may change as we learn from real usage and feedback.

If you've made it here and want to contribute: thank you 🙂

This is a **great time** to get involved in the project! We're at the beginning, so there's plenty of room to experiment, suggest changes, and see your contributions make a real difference. This document serves to align expectations and show where you can help in a simple and straightforward way.

## Project Overview (Current State)

The platform aims to provide an interactive environment to practice **React / Next.js** progressively, starting with fundamentals and evolving to more complex challenges.

Currently:

* The project is functional, but **rough**
* The interface is still provisional
* Not all exercises have been tested to the limit
* Requirements are still being defined

This is expected at this stage.

---

## Where the Project Needs the Most Help Right Now

### 1️⃣ Interface (UI / UX)

The current interface is **provisional** and needs significant improvement.

Contributions welcome:

* Visual improvements
* Layout organization
* Clarity between instructions, editor, and rendering area
* Small usability adjustments

There is no final design defined — suggestions and experiments are welcome.

---

### 2️⃣ Testing (Break it! 😅)

One of the biggest needs right now is to **aggressively test** what already exists.

Worth doing:

* Try to break exercises
* Test unexpected inputs
* Look for strange behaviors in the editor or rendering
* Test different usage flows

Finding problems at this stage is **extremely valuable**.

---

### 3️⃣ Fixes

If something breaks during testing:

* Fixes are very welcome
* Small refactorings too
* Code readability improvements

No need to solve everything at once — small fixes already help a lot.

---

### 4️⃣ Creating New Exercises

This is central to the project.

#### Planned Structure (Milestone 1)

* **10 fundamental exercises** (learning foundation)
* From there, start creating in parallel:

  * More fundamental exercises
  * Challenges

Approximate final goal of this milestone:

* ~20 fundamental exercises
* ~15 challenges

> These numbers are **reference**, not obligation. They can be smaller.

Exercises should follow the idea of:

* Clear progression
* Focus on concepts (not just syntax)
* Real practice with React / Next.js

## How to Contribute

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the project locally:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Explore, test, break, experiment

### Creating Contributions

* Create a branch from main
* Branch naming pattern:

  * `feature/feature-name`
  * `fix/fix-name`
  * `refactor/refactor-name`

5. Make your commits
6. Push the branch
7. Open a Pull Request

The code will be reviewed, feedback will be given, and if everything is ok, it will be merged into the main branch.

---

## About Review and Decisions

* This project has **centralized review**
* Feedback is part of the process
* Some decisions may change as the project evolves

The focus here is **collective learning** - we're building together.

---

## Important

* There is no delivery obligation
* There is no deadline pressure
* Small contributions are as valid as large ones

If something is not clear, ask.

Thank you for contributing 🚀
